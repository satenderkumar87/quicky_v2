# 🤖 OpenAI Model Updates & Compatibility

## ⚠️ Important Model Changes

### Deprecated Models
The following models have been deprecated and should no longer be used:
- ❌ `gpt-4-vision-preview` (deprecated)
- ❌ `gpt-4-1106-vision-preview` (deprecated)
- ❌ `gpt-4-0125-preview` (deprecated)

### ✅ Current Recommended Models (2024)

#### Primary Models
- **`gpt-4o`** - Latest GPT-4 Omni model with built-in vision capabilities
  - Best performance for both text and vision tasks
  - Higher cost but superior quality
  - Recommended for production use

#### Alternative Models
- **`gpt-4o-mini`** - Smaller, faster, cheaper version of GPT-4o
  - Good performance at lower cost
  - Suitable for development and testing
  - Still has vision capabilities

## 🔄 What We Updated

### 1. Model Selection
```python
# OLD (deprecated)
self.model = "gpt-4-vision-preview"
self.text_model = "gpt-4"

# NEW (current)
self.model = "gpt-4o"           # Vision + text in one model
self.text_model = "gpt-4o"      # Same model for consistency
```

### 2. Vision API Parameters
```python
# Enhanced image analysis with better parameters
{
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": {
        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_data['image_base64']}",
        "detail": "high"  # Added for better analysis
    }
}
```

### 3. Improved Parameters
```python
# Better parameters for more consistent results
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.model,
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=1500,    # Increased for detailed analysis
    temperature=0.1     # Lower for more consistent results
)
```

## 🛠️ Model Checker Integration

### Automatic Model Detection
We've added a `ModelChecker` class that:
- ✅ Checks available models in your OpenAI account
- ✅ Automatically selects the best available model
- ✅ Warns about deprecated models
- ✅ Provides fallback options

### Usage
```python
from agent.model_checker import ModelChecker

checker = ModelChecker()
checker.print_model_status()  # Shows current model status
best_models = checker.get_best_models()  # Gets recommended models
```

## 📊 Model Comparison

| Model | Vision | Text | Speed | Cost | Best For |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|----------|
| `gpt-4o` | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | Medium | High | Production |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | Fast | Low | Development |
| `gpt-4-vision-preview` | ❌ Deprecated | ❌ Deprecated | - | - | Don't use |

## 🔧 How to Check Your Models

### Method 1: Use Our Model Checker
```bash
cd /home/satender/hackathon/quicky3
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "from agent.model_checker import ModelChecker; ModelChecker().print_model_status()"
```

### Method 2: Manual Check
```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
models = client.models.list()
for model in models.data:
    if 'gpt-4' in model.id:
        print(model.id)
```

### Method 3: OpenAI Dashboard
Visit [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) to see available models.

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### GPT-4o Pricing (as of 2024)
- **Input**: $5.00 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $15.00 per 1M tokens
- **Vision**: Same as text pricing

### GPT-4o-mini Pricing
- **Input**: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $0.60 per 1M tokens
- **Vision**: Same as text pricing

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Use gpt-4o-mini for development** - Much cheaper for testing
2. **Use gpt-4o for production** - Better quality for final results
3. **Optimize prompts** - Shorter prompts = lower costs
4. **Set max_tokens** - Prevent unexpectedly long responses

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### If You're Using Old Models
1. **Update your code** - Replace deprecated model names
2. **Test thoroughly** - New models may produce slightly different outputs
3. **Monitor costs** - New models have different pricing
4. **Update documentation** - Reflect new model usage

### Automatic Migration
Our system now automatically:
- ✅ Detects deprecated models
- ✅ Suggests current alternatives
- ✅ Falls back to working models
- ✅ Warns about compatibility issues

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Model not found" Error
```
Error: The model `gpt-4-vision-preview` does not exist
```
**Solution**: Update to `gpt-4o`

#### "Insufficient quota" Error
```
Error: You exceeded your current quota
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check your OpenAI billing limits
2. Use `gpt-4o-mini` for lower costs
3. Add payment method to your OpenAI account

#### "Access denied" Error
```
Error: You don't have access to this model
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check if you have GPT-4 access
2. Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` as fallback
3. Contact OpenAI support for access
